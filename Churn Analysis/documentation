Built a BI report relating to churn analysis based on bank customer data under the guidance of Bi with Gurpreet.


Steps involved were fetching the data, transform data, build clean data, executing certain operations and presenting the data

In this report I studied the perecentage of gender, activity status, credit card status, country and types of products  which was taken in consideration to built this project.
Also a study was done to undersatnd the churn rate based on the number or customer and credit score range, age groups and account balance range.
